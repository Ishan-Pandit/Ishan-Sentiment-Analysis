# Sentiment Analysis of a WhatsApp Chat

Hello! I am Ishan Pandit (rollno: 22b2141), and this repository contains my Python code for sentiment analysis of WhatsApp chats. 

The initial part of my code focuses on preprocessing exported chat data. This includes handling date-time formats and identifying message authors. I defined functions to streamline and simplify this process, ensuring less confusion while reading the code.

For the chat analysed in the code, I simply exported one of my WhatsApp chats, saved it (without media to reduce the possibility of error), and provided the file path in the code.

I used the nltk (Natural Language ToolKit) library for the sentiment analysis part of the code. The code calculates sentiment scores for each message â€”distinguishing between positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. This is done using a sentiment analyser function present in the nltk library. Finally, I compared the cumulative sentiment analysis scores, and thus determined the predominant emotion throughout the chat!
